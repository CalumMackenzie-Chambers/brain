# [ðŸ§  My personal knowledge hub](/)

This is my personal knowledge hub, where I collect all the things I learn.

:::note
As the project is still in its early stages, there is a lot of missing content. I will be continually adding to it as I progress.

## [Introduction](#introduction)

I am a software engineer and have been in the industry since 2020. My passion is for learning and sharing my knowledge. That's why I created this knowledge hub as a platform to share all that I have learned. I hope you find it helpful.

## [How to Use This Site](#how-to-use-this-site)

This site is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) and hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). You can access the source code by clicking the "GitHub" icon in the top-right corner of the page.

The site is organized into sections, which may change and move as I add more content. You can access each section through the sidebar on the left. Some sections are individual pages, while others are collections of pages. Individual pages are listed in the sidebar and collections are listed as dropdown menus. You can also navigate to the main page of a collection by clicking its name.

I plan to add a search bar to the site as it grows, but for now it should be easy to navigate using only the sidebar.

I studied Aeronautics and Astronautics at [The University of Southampton](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/) between 2017 and 2020. It was during my first year there that I discovered my love for programming during a computing module. I am currently in my second year of studying Computer Science at [Queen Mary University of London](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/).

In addition, I work as a software engineer at [Infuse Consulting](https://infuse.it/) and have previous experience as a data analyst at [AMFA](https://assetmanagement.co.uk/).
