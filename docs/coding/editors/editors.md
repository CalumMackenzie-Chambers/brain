# [Editors and IDE's](#title)

In this section I will talk about the different code editors that I have used to write code. After trying most of the main offerings such as VS Code, Visual Studio and the JetBrains suite of tools, I ended up settling on [neovim](https://neovim.io/). Switching to neovim was a struggle to begin with as I had to work out not only how to use the modal system, but also how to configure the editor to have some of the features that I was missing from my experience in other editors. You can find an explanation of my config and how I ended up with it [here](./neovim)
